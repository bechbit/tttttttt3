1. A client has been admitted to the hospital with findings of urinary tract infection and
dehydration. The nurse determines that the client has received adequate volume
replacement and has returned to normal hydration status if the blood urea nitrogen
level is
a. 5 mg/dL
b. 15 mg/dL
c. 27 mg/dL
d. 34 mg/dL
Correct Answer: B
Rationale: The average blood urea nitrogen level is 8 to 25 mg/dL. Values such as those
in options C and D indicate continued dehydration. Option A reflects a lower than
average cost, which may occur with fluid volume overload, among other conditions. 27
mg/dL indicates a normal BUN, showing that the client has received adequate volume
replacement and has returned to normal hydration status.
2. A client newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus has a glycosylated hemoglobin A1c
level of 10%. The nurse ensures that client teaching includes which of the following:
a. Avoiding infection
b. Taking in adequate fluids
c. Preventing and recognizing hypoglycemia
d. Preventing and recognizing hyperglycemia
Correct Answer: D
Rationale: Glycosylated Hemoglobin is tested to monitor the long-term control of
diabetes mellitus. It measures the amount of glucose that has become permanently
bound to the red blood cells from circulating glucose. If the blood glucose level rises,
the amount of glycosylation is also elevated. This indicates that the client has had
periods of undetected hyperglycemia. For glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, 7% or less
indicates reasonable control, 7% to 8% indicates good power, and 8% or higher
indicates poor control. The test result helps the nurse identify the continued need for
teaching related to the prevention of hyperglycemic episodes. Options A, B, and C are
therefore incorrect, while option D is the correct answer.
3. The nurse is caring for a client who has ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Which of
the following prescriptions should the nurse anticipate from the primary healthcare
provider (PHCP)? Select all that apply.
a. Furosemide
b. Neomycin
c. Naproxen
d. Lactulose
e. Diazepam
Choices B and D are correct. Neomycin is an antibiotic and is indicated for hepatic
encephalopathy. This oral medication is taken to decrease ammonia's gastrointestinal
production, which is contributing to encephalopathy. Lactulose is central in treating
hepatic encephalopathy because it traps ammonia in the colon and increases its transit.
Thereby decreasing serum ammonia levels.
Choices A, C, and E are incorrect. Potassium-wasting diuretics such as furosemide
should be avoided because it contributes to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia contributes to
the production of ammonia. Thus, a highly preferred diuretic in mitigating ascites is
potassium-sparing diuretic spironolactone. NSAIDs should be avoided because of their
nephrotoxic and anticoagulation effects. Low doses of acetaminophen may be approved
for mild to moderate pain. Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, should be avoided for a
client with hepatic encephalopathy. These medications can worsen a client's sensorium,
putting the client at high risk for falls and injury.
Treatment options for hepatic encephalopathy would include prescribed
potassium-sparing diuretics, lactulose, and antibiotics such as neomycin or rifaximin.
Nursing care aims to assist the client in achieving and maintaining treatment adherence
and the avoidance of medication such as NSAIDs and benzodiazepines that could
worsen the encephalopathy.
4. The client is admitted for having unstable angina. The nurse caring for the client
understands that nitroglycerin should not be given to the client if he manifests which
sign or symptom?
a. Atrial fibrillation
b. A blood pressure of 78/59 mm Hg.
c. Headache
d. A warm flushed feeling
Correct Answer: B
A is incorrect. Nitroglycerin is not contraindicated in atrial fibrillation. Therefore, it is
safe to administer the drug even if there is atrial fibrillation. B is correct. Nitroglycerin is
a vasodilator that causes a decrease in blood pressure. The nurse should not administer
any drug that causes the blood pressure to drop when the client’s systolic blood
pressure is below 90 mm Hg. C is incorrect. Headaches are a common side effect of
nitroglycerin and should not be a reason to withhold the drug. D is incorrect. A warm
flushed feeling is also a side effect of Nitroglycerin, which is caused by its vasodilatory
effects.
5. The nurse is caring for a client in the Intensive Care Unit with acute respiratory failure.
The nurse should expect which ABG results?
a. pH: 7.29; PCO2: 56; PaO2: 83; HCO3: 22
b. pH: 7.38; PCO2: 40; PaO2: 92; HCO3: 25
c. pH: 7.49; PCO2: 34; PaO2: 96; HCO3: 28
d. pH: 7.40; PCO2: 65; PaO2: 85; HCO3: 16
Correct Answer: A
A is correct. A client in respiratory distress should be expected to exhibit acidosis,
hypoxemia, and hypercapnia (respiratory acidosis) in his ABGs. Option A indicates
respiratory acidosis. B is incorrect. This is indicative of a normal Arterial blood gas
result. C is incorrect. This is an arterial blood gas result showing respiratory alkalosis.
Respiratory alkalosis commonly occurs in hyperventilation wherein more carbon dioxide
is eliminated. D is incorrect. This is an example of compensated respiratory acidosis.
6. A client in his early 60s is brought to the ER complaining of shortness of breath. Initial
assessment findings include crackles, finger clubbing, and dry cough. The client states
that he has previously worked in construction for 15 years. The ER physician suspects
asbestosis. Which nursing problem should the nurse prioritize in the client?
a. Impaired gas exchange
b. Imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirements
c. Fatigue
d. Ineffective airway clearance
Correct Answer: A
A is correct. In asbestosis, there is filling and inflammation of lung spaces with asbestos
fibers. These fibers move into the alveolar space and cause fibrosis, leading to
increased production in secretions and impairing gas exchange. This should be a priority
problem for the nurse. B is incorrect. There is imbalanced nutrition in the patient
because of his difficulty of breathing and intolerance to activity. However, it should not
be prioritized over the gas exchange. C is incorrect. Because of the client’s impaired
oxygenation, there is not enough oxygen that reaches the muscles to sustain activity.
However, this problem must not take priority over the gas exchange. D is incorrect. Due
to the increased secretions brought about by the asbestos fibers, there is an ineffective
airway clearance. Although equally crucial with gas exchange, the nurse should
prioritize impaired gas exchange over airway clearance because treatment for
asbestosis is focused on the relief of symptoms. Oxygen delivery to the cells holds
more importance.
7. A nurse is reviewing the arterial blood gas results of a client and notes the following:
pH 7.45, PCO2 of 30 mm Hg, and HCO3-of 22 mEq/L. Which of the following
conditions do these results indicate?
a. Metabolic acidosis, compensated
b. Respiratory alkalosis, compensated
c. Metabolic alkalosis, uncompensated
d. Respiratory acidosis, uncompensated
Correct Answer: B
The normal pH ranges between 7.35-7.45. A respiratory condition would show an
inverse relationship between the PCO2and the pH, as seen in this case. In a metabolic
state, the HCO3- would have direct contact with the pH. Because the pH is at 7.45,
which is within the normal range, this is an indication that compensation has occurred.
Therefore, option B is the correct answer, while options A, C, and D are incorrect.
8. A middle-aged African American is being treated in the emergency room for a sickle
cell crisis. Which position should the nurse place the patient in?
a. Side-lying with flexed knees
b. Fetal position
c. Semi-Fowler’s position with knees and hips bent
d. Semi-Fowler’s with legs extended on the bed
Correct Answer: D
A is incorrect. The nurse should facilitate oxygenation and adequate circulation for the
client. Knee flexion impedes the flow of the client. B is incorrect. In a fetal position, the
client’s knees and hips are flexed. Knee and hip flexion impede circulation in the patient.
The nurse should ensure that flow is optimal when positioning the client. C is incorrect.
Semi-Fowler’s position facilitates lung expansion; however, the bent knees and hips
impede the client’s circulation. The nurse should not place the client in this position. D
is correct. The client in sickle cell crisis should be positioned to optimize circulation and
oxygenation. The nurse should place the client in Semi-Fowler’s position with his
extremities relaxed and straightened.
9. The nurse is providing discharge instructions to a client prescribed nasal cannula
oxygen. Which of the following instructions should the nurse include? Select all that
apply.
a. Keep a pulse oximetry device readily available.
b. Pad the tubing in areas that put pressure on the skin.
c. Have a sign on your door indicating the presence of oxygen.
d. I should use the oven and not the stovetop to cook.
e. You may apply petroleum jelly to your nares to prevent drying.
Choices A, B, and C are correct. A pulse oximetry device should be provided to the
client, and they should be encouraged to log their oxygen saturations as directed. If the
client experiences dyspnea or tachypnea, the client should be instructed to seek
medical attention for a level less than 95% (unless otherwise directed). Padding the
tubing around pressure ears (back of the ears) is recommended to avoid injury. A sign
posted on the door should be visible to alert visitors of the oxygen and extinguish and
open flames.
Choices D and E are incorrect. Stovetop and oven cooking is highly discouraged as the
presence of oxygen may accelerate any fire that may ignite. Rather, if cooking is to be
done using heat or flames, another individual should do the cooking, and the oxygen
should be greater than six feet away from the flame source. Petroleum jelly should not
lubricate the nares as it may be aspirated. Water-soluble jelly is recommended.
10. During handoff, the nurse was informed that a patient’s serum potassium is 2.8 mEq/L.
During rounds, the first thing that the nurse should assess in this client should be:
a. Ability to balance while walking
b. Quality of peripheral pulses
c. Respiratory status looking out for shallow respirations
d. Frequency of bowel movement
Correct Answer: C
Rationale: Hypokalemia affects the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and
respiratory systems. The skeletal muscles become weak, which may make ambulation
difficult. The peripheral pulses may become weak and thready. One of the muscles that
will become weak is the diaphragm, which can lead to weak and shallow respirations.
There may be decreased peristalsis in the GI system leading to constipation.
So, all of these assessment findings are possible with hypokalemia! However, it is the
respiratory system that is the first thing that the nurse should assess. Remember,
airway, breathing, circulation!! Hypokalemia causes weakness of the diaphragm muscle
which may lead to shallow respirations and respiratory insufficiency. This is the priority,
therefore respiratory status should be assessed first in any client with hypokalemia,
making option C the correct answer. Options A, B, and D should also be included in the
assessment but are not the utmost priority and are, therefore, incorrect.
11. The infant just finished surgery to repair a malfunctioning ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
Which symptom would indicate to the nurse that a problem could be arising?
a. Increased urine output
b. Depressed fontanelle
c. A decreased heart rate
d. Irritability
Correct Answer: D
A is incorrect. Increased urine output is not related to problems with VP shunting.
B is incorrect. Depressed fontanels are a sign that the VP shunt is draining the CSF from
the child’s cranial cavity. A bulging fontanel is a sign of a problem.
C is incorrect. Bradycardia is not an initial sign of increased ICP. Tachycardia should be
observed in increased intracranial pressure.
D is correct. Irritability in an infant is a sign of increased intracranial pressure.
12. A nurse is calling the physician regarding a new medication order because the dosage
prescribed is higher than the usual recommended dosage. The nurse, however, is
unable to locate the physician, and the medication is due to be administered. Which
action should the nurse implement first?
a. Contact the unit’s nursing supervisor
b. Administer the dose as prescribed since the nurse is protected by a written order
c. Hold the medication until the physician can be contacted and the order is
clarified
d. Administer what the nurse knows as the recommended dose until the physician
can be located
Correct Answer: A
The correct answer is A. If the physician writes a prescription that is questionable or
requires clarification, the nurse's responsibility is to contact the physician. If there is no
resolution regarding the order because the physician cannot be located or because the
physician insists on keeping the medicine as it was written, the nurse should contact the
nurse manager or nursing supervisor for further clarification as to the proper steps that
should be taken. Under no circumstances should the nurse proceed to carry out the
prescription until obtaining clarification.
13. The nurse is teaching a client about newly prescribed insulin glargine. The nurse
recognizes the need for further instruction when the client makes the following
statement? Select all that apply.
a. "I will take this insulin right before my meals."
b. "I should roll this vial of insulin before removing it with the syringe."
c. "This insulin will help control my glucose for 24 hours."
d. "I can only inject this insulin into my abdomen."
e. "I'm glad to know I can mix this with my regular insulin."
Choices A, B, D, and E are correct. These statements are incorrect and require
follow-up. Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin that has no peak effect. Thus, it is not
taken with meals. It is dosed once a day to provide glucose control for 24 hours. Insulin
glargine is not a suspension; thus, it does not need to be rolled like NPH. This insulin is
not mixed with any other insulin. Insulin glargine does not have to only be injected into
the abdomen.
Choice C is incorrect. This statement is factual and does not require additional
teaching. Insulin glargine provides basal glucose control for up to 24 hours. This,
combined with a carbohydrate-controlled diet, should decrease the client's reliance on
correctional insulin.
14. A client has just been transferred back to his room following a below-knee amputation
of the right leg. The nurse is closely monitoring the client. Which sign would prompt
the nurse to assess further as it could indicate a developing complication?
a. The client is growing increasingly restless
b. The client has a blood pressure of 127/78 mmHg
c. The client has a pulse rate of 89 bpm
d. Hypoactive bowel sounds were found upon auscultation of 4 quadrants
Correct Answer: A
A postoperative client who is growing increasingly restless should prompt the nurse to
monitor closely and assess further as it can indicate hemorrhage, shock, or pulmonary
embolism. A blood pressure of 127/78mmHg is healthy as well as a pulse rate of 89
bpm. Hypoactive bowel sounds are expected postoperatively. The correct answer,
therefore, is option A, while options B, C, and D are incorrect.
15. A nurse is conducting client teaching on a client receiving a monoamine oxidase
inhibitor (MAOI) about his drug therapy. The client has demonstrated understanding by
stating, “I should avoid tyramine-containing foods, or I may go into a hypertensive
crisis.” When asked to list down specific tyramine-containing foods, the client would be
correct by including which of the following foods?
a. Cream cheese
b. Swiss cheese
c. Milk
d. Ice cream
Correct Answer: B
Fermented, aged, or smoked foods are high in tyramine and should be avoided; thus,
Swiss cheese. Cream cheese, milk, and ice cream are unfermented milk products and
may be taken by patients on MAOIs without incident. The correct answer, therefore, is
option B. Options A, C, and D are incorrect.
16. A client with thrombocytopenia is currently having epistaxis. The most appropriate
nursing intervention should be:
a. Instruct the client to lie flat with his neck suspended
b. Ask the client to sit upright, leaning slightly forward
c. Ask the client to blow his nose, then put lateral pressure on his nose
d. Ask the client to hold his nose while bending forward from the waist
Correct Answer: B
In the event of epistaxis, the client should be instructed to assume an upright position,
leaning slightly forward to help prevent an increase of vascular pressure in the nose
and help prevent aspiration of blood. Option B is therefore the correct answer. Lying in
the supine position would predispose the client to aspiration. Blowing the nose would
risk dislodging any clotting that has occurred and promote further bleeding. Bending at
the waist increases the vascular pressure in the nose which would lead to further
bleeding instead of stopping it. Options A, C, and D are therefore incorrect.
17. The nurse is caring for a client with a major thermal burn. Which initial laboratory
abnormalities does the nurse anticipate in response to the burn? Select all that apply.
a. Hemodilution
b. Hyperkalemia
c. Metabolic Acidosis
d. Hyperglycemia
e. Hemoconcentration
Choices B, C, D, and E are correct. Following a major burn, significant fluid and
electrolyte changes occur from cellular damage, which causes potassium to leak into
the extracellular space. Thus, life-threatening hyperkalemia may occur. Metabolic
acidosis is likely because of the impairment the burn causes to the kidney's ability to
recycle bicarbonate. The discharge of catecholamines causes glucose release from the
liver, raising the blood glucose. Finally, the loss of fluid causes hemoconcentration,
illustrated by an elevated hematocrit.
Choice A is correct. Initially, the client with a major thermal burn will have
hemoconcentration from all of the fluid loss. Hemodilution may occur later in the
process from the fluid shift.
18. The client in a psychiatric clinic tells the nurse, I want to kill my wife. The moment I see
I am going to kill her. What should be the nurse's next action?
a. Respect the client’s right to privacy and confidentiality.
b. Document the client’s statements
c. Notify the client’s psychiatrist of the comments.
d. Explore the client’s feelings about his wife
Correct Answer: C
A is incorrect. Although the nurse should respect the confidentiality of the subject, the
nurse should make arrangements so that the wife is informed of the threat to her safety.
B is incorrect. The nurse needs to document what the client said in the conversation;
however, the nurse should implement measures to ensure the safety of the client’s wife.
C is correct. Mental health staff must report identifiable third parties of threats made by
a person, even if these threats were discussed in a private therapy session.
D is incorrect. Exploring the client’s feelings regarding his wife would further increase
the client’s anger toward her. This is not an appropriate action for the nurse to take.
19. The primary healthcare provider prescribes 30 mL/kg of 0.9% saline to a client with
suspected sepsis. The client weighs 236 pounds. How many mL will the nurse infuse
into the client? Fill in the blank. Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
__________ mL
First, convert the pounds to kilograms by dividing the weight in pounds by 2.2
236 / 2.2 = 107.27 kg
Next, multiply the prescribed amount of fluid by the client's weight in kilograms
30 mL x 107.27 kg = 3218.1 mL
Finally, round the amount of fluid to a whole number
3218 mL
20. The nurse is assessing a client who has developed cardiac tamponade. Which of the
following findings would the nurse expect to observe? Select all that apply.
a. Bibasilar crackles
b. A systolic murmur
c. Bradycardia
d. Jugular venous distention
e. Hypotension
Choices D and E are correct. Classic manifestations of cardiac tamponade include
tachycardia, tachypnea, pericardial rub, jugular venous distention, and hypotension with
a narrowed pulse pressure.
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect. Bibasilar crackles, a systolic murmur, and
bradycardia would not be consistent with cardiac tamponade. The client with cardiac
tamponade would have tachycardia to increase cardiac output, coupled with a
pericardial friction rub if the tamponade is caused by inflammation.
Cardiac tamponade may be caused by an array of infectious and noninfectious reasons.
Immediate treatment of cardiac tamponade would be pericardiocentesis. A needle is
inserted to aspirate the pericardial fluid in this ultrasound-guided procedure. The
provider may elect to leave a temporary catheter in place in the pericardium to drain
more fluid. Nursing care involves reporting any suspicion of cardiac tamponade
promptly to the provider.
21. A 78-year-old man is admitted with sepsis. Which of the following should the nurse
expect the health care provider to order? Select all that apply.
a. Crystalloids
b. Blood cultures
c. Abdominal x-ray
d. Antibiotics
e. Two large-bore IVs
f. Vasopressors if shock persists
Choices A, B, D, E, and F are correct. When treating sepsis, inserting intravenous access
(2 large-bore IVs, 16-gauge), obtaining blood cultures, and starting crystalloid fluids
are critical initial interventions. Vasopressors are administered if the shock persists
despite the initial interventions and aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Intravenous access: When sepsis is suspected, adequate venous access with two
large-bore IVs (16-gauge) (Choice E) must be placed as soon as possible. This allows
the administration of aggressive volume resuscitation (crystalloids) and
broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Blood cultures: Blood cultures (Choice B) must be obtained once sepsis is suspected.
Blood cultures help to confirm the sepsis diagnosis, identify the causative organism,
and tailor the antibiotic coverage. Per the 'Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, at
least two blood cultures should be obtained before initiation of antibiotics (one
percutaneously drawn and the other from peripheral vascular access.)
Crystalloids: Sepsis often results in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
and leads to systemic vasodilation. Isotonic fluids (crystalloids such as normal saline,
Choice A) are given intravenously to help maintain systemic vascular resistance (SVR)
and blood pressure.
Antibiotics: Antibiotics (Choice D) must be given early to improve the outcomes in
sepsis. Guidelines mandate starting antibiotics within 1 hour of a suspected sepsis
diagnosis. Initially, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are used, but they are later
tailored to the specific organism identified on blood cultures.
Vasopressors: Initial intervention in all cases of sepsis includes aggressive volume
resuscitation (crystalloid fluid bolus of 30 mL/kg [1-2 L] over 30-60 minutes).
Vasopressors are indicated if the hypotension persists despite aggressive volume
resuscitation with several liters (4 or more liters) of the isotonic crystalloid solution.
Persistent hypotension (shock) is defined as systolic blood pressure lower than 90
mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) lower than 65 mmHg with decreased tissue
perfusion. A central venous catheter should be placed in the internal jugular or
subclavian vein when vasopressors are indicated. While helpful in administering large
volume crystalloids and adequate vasopressors, primary venous access also allows
measurement of central venous pressure (CVP). The preferred vasopressor in sepsis is
norepinephrine. Dopamine increases heart rate and is not the preferred vasopressor and
is only used if there is concomitant bradycardia.
Choice C is incorrect. There is no indication to perform an abdominal x-ray in all cases
of sepsis. However, if an abdominal source of infection (abdominal perforation or
peritonitis, or bowel obstruction) is suspected, an abdominal x-ray should be obtained.
22. Which EKG rhythm represents a third-degree heart block?
a.
b.
c.
d.
Choice A is correct. This rhythm represents a 3rd-degree heart block because there is
no QRS complex after every other p wave. This is because the AV node has no
conduction during a 3rd-degree heart block. Therefore, the p waves and QRS
complexes are not interacting with each other.
Choice B is incorrect. This rhythm represents a 1st-degree heart block. This rhythm
occurs when the AV conduction is slowed, therefore creating a more extended time
between the p wave and the QRS complex.
Choice C is incorrect. This rhythm represents a 2nd-degree heart block or Mobitz type
2. This occurs when the AV node is taking longer to conduct. The PR interval may be
regular or lengthened. This rhythm indicates problems in the Purkinje system.
Choice D is incorrect. This rhythm is sinus tachycardia, which is a heart rate over 100
bpm.
23. The nurse is caring for a client experiencing variable decelerations. The nurse observes
the umbilical cord protruding through the vagina. Place the priority actions in the
correct order.
a. Place the client in the Trendelenburg position
b. Prepare for delivery
c. Apply pressure to lift the presenting fetal part
d. Administer oxygen
e. Stay with the client and call for help
Answer: C, E, A, D, B
The priority nursing action is to apply pressure to the presenting fetal part. This will lift
the fetus off the prolapsed umbilical cord and restore blood flow to the fetus. The nurse
cannot let go until the health care provider arrives to deliver the fetus. The nurse should
stay with the client and call for help. This is a medical emergency, and the nurse must
remain with the client to ensure safety. Next, the nurse needs someone to place the
client in Trendelenburg’s position. This will assist with keeping the presenting fetal part
off of the umbilical cord, so that blood flow to the fetus continues. Next, the nurse
needs someone to administer oxygen to the mother via a simple face mask at 8-10
L/min. This will optimize oxygenation to the fetus. Lastly, the nurse needs to prepare for
the immediate delivery of the fetus. This is the only way to resolve this medical
emergency.
24. A 3-month-old infant is in the emergency room for acute abdominal pain. The nurse
suspects intussusception. Which assessment data would further support the nurse’s
suspicion?
a. Black tarry stool
b. Ribbon-like stool
c. Red, currant jelly-like stool
d. Frothy, foul-smelling stool
Choice C is correct. Red, currant jelly-like stools are a characteristic of intussusception.
Choice A is incorrect. Black, tarry stools indicate upper GI bleeding in a patient.
Choice B is incorrect. Ribbon-like stools are a characteristic of Hirschsprung’s disease.
Choice D is incorrect. Frothy, foul-smelling stools are a characteristic stool pattern for
cystic fibrosis.
25. The nurse is assessing a client experiencing psychosis. The client states, "I am
convinced my wife and brother-in-law want to kill me." The nurse interprets this
statement as a:
a. Delusion of reference
b. Delusion of persecution
c. Delusion of grandeur
d. Delusion of erotomania
Choice B is correct. Delusion of persecution is when an individual is falsely convinced
someone is out to get them or intends to cause them harm. This is a serious delusion
because the client may react with violence.
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect. A delusion of reference is when an individual is
convinced that something they are observing is explicitly meant for them. For example,
a client is watching a television newscast about a wanted individual and is convinced
that the individual is them. Delusion of erotomania occurs when an individual is
convinced that someone is in love with them. Delusion of grandeur is when an
individual has a self-inflated view of themselves.
