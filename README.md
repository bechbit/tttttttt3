### 1. A client has been admitted to the hospital with findings of urinary tract infection and

- [ ] 5 mg/dL
- [x] 15 mg/dL
- [ ] 27 mg/dL
- [ ] 34 mg/dL

**Rationale:**
Rationale: The average blood urea nitrogen level is 8 to 25 mg/dL. Values such as those in options C and D indicate continued dehydration. Option A reflects a lower than average cost, which may occur with fluid volume overload, among other conditions. 27 mg/dL indicates a normal BUN, showing that the client has received adequate volume replacement and has returned to normal hydration status.

### 2. A client newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus has a glycosylated hemoglobin A1c

- [ ] Avoiding infection
- [ ] Taking in adequate fluids
- [ ] Preventing and recognizing hypoglycemia
- [x] Preventing and recognizing hyperglycemia

**Rationale:**
Rationale: Glycosylated Hemoglobin is tested to monitor the long-term control of diabetes mellitus. It measures the amount of glucose that has become permanently bound to the red blood cells from circulating glucose. If the blood glucose level rises, the amount of glycosylation is also elevated. This indicates that the client has had periods of undetected hyperglycemia. For glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, 7% or less indicates reasonable control, 7% to 8% indicates good power, and 8% or higher indicates poor control. The test result helps the nurse identify the continued need for teaching related to the prevention of hyperglycemic episodes. Options A, B, and C are therefore incorrect, while option D is the correct answer.

### 10. During handoff, the nurse was informed that a patient’s serum potassium is 2.8 mEq/L.

- [ ] Ability to balance while walking
- [ ] Quality of peripheral pulses
- [x] Respiratory status looking out for shallow respirations
- [ ] Frequency of bowel movement

**Rationale:**
Rationale: Hypokalemia affects the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and respiratory systems. The skeletal muscles become weak, which may make ambulation difficult. The peripheral pulses may become weak and thready. One of the muscles that will become weak is the diaphragm, which can lead to weak and shallow respirations. There may be decreased peristalsis in the GI system leading to constipation. So, all of these assessment findings are possible with hypokalemia! However, it is the respiratory system that is the first thing that the nurse should assess. Remember, airway, breathing, circulation!! Hypokalemia causes weakness of the diaphragm muscle which may lead to shallow respirations and respiratory insufficiency. This is the priority, therefore respiratory status should be assessed first in any client with hypokalemia, making option C the correct answer. Options A, B, and D should also be included in the assessment but are not the utmost priority and are, therefore, incorrect.
