### 1. A client has been admitted to the hospital with findings of urinary tract infection and dehydration. The nurse determines that the client has received adequate volume replacement and has returned to normal hydration status if the blood urea nitrogen level is

- [ ] 5 mg/dL
- [x] 15 mg/dL
- [ ] 27 mg/dL
- [ ] 34 mg/dL

**Rationale:**
Rationale: The average blood urea nitrogen level is 8 to 25 mg/dL. Values such as those in options C and D indicate continued dehydration. Option A reflects a lower than average cost, which may occur with fluid volume overload, among other conditions. 27 mg/dL indicates a normal BUN, showing that the client has received adequate volume replacement and has returned to normal hydration status.

### 2. A client newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus has a glycosylated hemoglobin A1c

- [ ] Avoiding infection
- [ ] Taking in adequate fluids
- [ ] Preventing and recognizing hypoglycemia
- [x] Preventing and recognizing hyperglycemia

**Rationale:**
level of 10%. The nurse ensures that client teaching includes which of the following: Rationale: Glycosylated Hemoglobin is tested to monitor the long-term control of diabetes mellitus. It measures the amount of glucose that has become permanently bound to the red blood cells from circulating glucose. If the blood glucose level rises, the amount of glycosylation is also elevated. This indicates that the client has had periods of undetected hyperglycemia. For glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, 7% or less indicates reasonable control, 7% to 8% indicates good power, and 8% or higher indicates poor control. The test result helps the nurse identify the continued need for teaching related to the prevention of hyperglycemic episodes. Options A, B, and C are therefore incorrect, while option D is the correct answer.

### 3. The nurse is caring for a client who has ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Which of

- [x] Furosemide
- [x] Neomycin
- [x] Naproxen
- [x] Lactulose

**Rationale:**
the following prescriptions should the nurse anticipate from the primary healthcare provider (PHCP)? Select all that apply. e. Diazepam Choices B and D are correct. Neomycin is an antibiotic and is indicated for hepatic encephalopathy. This oral medication is taken to decrease ammonia's gastrointestinal production, which is contributing to encephalopathy. Lactulose is central in treating hepatic encephalopathy because it traps ammonia in the colon and increases its transit. Thereby decreasing serum ammonia levels. Choices A, C, and E are incorrect. Potassium-wasting diuretics such as furosemide should be avoided because it contributes to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia contributes to the production of ammonia. Thus, a highly preferred diuretic in mitigating ascites is potassium-sparing diuretic spironolactone. NSAIDs should be avoided because of their nephrotoxic and anticoagulation effects. Low doses of acetaminophen may be approved for mild to moderate pain. Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, should be avoided for a client with hepatic encephalopathy. These medications can worsen a client's sensorium, putting the client at high risk for falls and injury. Treatment options for hepatic encephalopathy would include prescribed potassium-sparing diuretics, lactulose, and antibiotics such as neomycin or rifaximin. Nursing care aims to assist the client in achieving and maintaining treatment adherence and the avoidance of medication such as NSAIDs and benzodiazepines that could worsen the encephalopathy.

### 10. During handoff, the nurse was informed that a patient’s serum potassium is 2.8 mEq/L. During rounds, the first thing that the nurse should assess in this client should be:

- [ ] Ability to balance while walking
- [ ] Quality of peripheral pulses
- [x] Respiratory status looking out for shallow respirations
- [ ] Frequency of bowel movement

**Rationale:**
Rationale: Hypokalemia affects the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and respiratory systems. The skeletal muscles become weak, which may make ambulation difficult. The peripheral pulses may become weak and thready. One of the muscles that will become weak is the diaphragm, which can lead to weak and shallow respirations. There may be decreased peristalsis in the GI system leading to constipation. So, all of these assessment findings are possible with hypokalemia! However, it is the respiratory system that is the first thing that the nurse should assess. Remember, airway, breathing, circulation!! Hypokalemia causes weakness of the diaphragm muscle which may lead to shallow respirations and respiratory insufficiency. This is the priority, therefore respiratory status should be assessed first in any client with hypokalemia, making option C the correct answer. Options A, B, and D should also be included in the assessment but are not the utmost priority and are, therefore, incorrect.
